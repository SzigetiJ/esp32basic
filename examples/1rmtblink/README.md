### LED blinking with RMT

In this example GPIO on/off timings are controlled by RMT.
D1 makes fast (0.1s long) blinking (with 0.1s gaps).
The main cycle starts the RMT TX process every 2 seconds.
First, a single blink is issued, next 2 blinks, etc. until 8 blinks.
Then the number of blinks starts again with 1.

#### Hardware components

* D1: ...
* R1: 470 Î© resistor

#### Connections

```
ESP32.GPIO2 -- R1 --(A) D1 (K)-- ESP32.GND
```

#### Practices

1. Make the blinking asymmetric (e.g., longer ON, shorter OFF phases).
2. Extend this setup with D2 (and R2) and bind it to RMT channel1.
3. Allocate more RAM to RMT channel0 and make longer blinks (0.5s long phases).
4. Before starting the blinking (overwriting the RMT RAM) check whether the RMT channel is in IDLE state.
As we currently do not have (documented) access to the RMT channel's status register,
examine (and set) the interrupt registers.
